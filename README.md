# Log-Me-In Tech Challenge App.

Built in Swift.

Created a simple iOS app with Login page and Home page. The login page used WKWebView and all WKNavigation methods. The app pass POST parameters in the body/header of request /authentication data to server through Cookie Authentication.

On successful login, user will be redirected to home page of the app, and the cookie has been stored in the device keychain for a specific time limit (say 2 hours).
